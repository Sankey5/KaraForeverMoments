                <p>Hi There!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I'm a 26-year-old photographer that recently moved from colorful Colorado to the legendary cowboy state; Texas.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I enjoy the golden sunsets, exploring mountains and strolling around cities and parks with my wonderful clients. I absolutely love to hang out with my clients in their messy homes and join them at their favorite hangout spots or on casual dates because it gives me the chance to capture them in their most authentic, relaxed state. I believe photos are not just about getting the perfect shot, it's about telling their unique story through forever-moments that feel intimate and genuine.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My passion for photography began at a young age, sparked by the fascination I had watching my dad carefully compose and develop his photos. By the time I was 9, digital cameras were evolving, and so was my love for capturing moments. Armed with my parents' camera, I eagerly snapped pictures at every family event, eager to freeze time. But it wasn't until high school when I got my first "real" camera-a Nikon D3200-that I truly found my artistic stride. That very year I was able to win a senior award in my freshman year. As the years passed, my camera became my constant companion. From lively birthday parties to intimate gatherings, and even helping friends with photos for modeling contests, I became the unofficial documentation of everyone's special moments. Each click of the shutter told a story, preserving not just memories, but emotions that would otherwise fade with time.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When I'm not behind the lens, you'll likely find me in the thick of family game nights, fiercely competing in board games, or taking long walks with my dog, Ace. My amazing husband and I also love exploring new exciting places, finding adventure in every corner of the world. But no matter where life takes me, I always return to photography-my ultimate way of telling stories, one frame at a time.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Being a photographer has been a passion of mine since growing up. It brings great joy to capture those beautiful raw emotions that will tell a story for a lifetime and bring happiness to my clients who will cherish their forever moments.</p>
